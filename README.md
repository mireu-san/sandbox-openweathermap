# Abstract
- This is to test and practice out the knowledge of adapting fetch api. In this project, inserted the local html key connection (via javascript) in that fetch request and its api key given by provider.
- The fetch notion is: "Request — This is the data you send to the API, like an order id to fetch the order details."
- There are four extra way to communicate asynchronously with API: get, post, put, delete. Every REST API should include at least three of them: request, response, headers.
- XMLHttpRequest sounds older version of restful api notion.

# Further plan (potential):
- I might improve some css in that main page.
